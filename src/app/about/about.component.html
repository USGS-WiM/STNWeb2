        <h2>WHISPers 2.0 Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <label class="about-header"> What is WHISPers?</label>
        <p>
          WHISPers stands for Wildlife Health Information Sharing Partnership - event reporting system. It is a
          partner-driven, web-based repository for sharing basic information about historic and ongoing wildlife
          mortality (death) and/or morbidity (illness) events. The information, such as county-level locations, onset and
          ending dates, species affected, and diagnosis has generously been shared with the USGS National Wildlife Health
          Center over time by hundreds of natural resource managers and stakeholders across the U.S. and beyond. The
          primary goal of the system is to provide natural resource management partners and the public with timely,
          accurate information on where wildlife disease events are occurring or have occurred for better preparation and
          decision making. The information is opportunistically collected and does not reflect all the mortality events
          that occur in North America. WHISPers is also the portal for requests for diagnostic and epidemiologic
          assistance from the USGS National Wildlife Health Center Diagnostic Laboratory.
